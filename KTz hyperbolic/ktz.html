            <h2>KTz hyperbolic model</h2>

            <p>
                A discrete-time map with three variables. It was derived from an Ising model 
                with competing interactions on a Bethe. Then, the hyperbolic tangent was simplified 
                into a logistic function, \(F(u) = u/(1 + |u|)\). Both this and the hyperbolic tangent 
                are sigmoid functions. They increase monotonically with limits \(F(u\to\pm\infty)=\pm1\),
                and their first derivatives are continuous, where \(F^\prime(u)=1/(1+|u|)^2\). 
                The advantages of this simplification are that all fixed points (FPs) become analytical 
                and the computational cost to iterate the map is drastically reduced, preserving the rich 
                repertoire of dynamical behaviors. We interpret our model as the membrane 
                voltage of a neuron or a cardiac myocyte over time. It is defined as

                \[
                \begin{align}
                    x(n+1) &= F\!\left(\frac{x(n) - K y(n) + z(n) + H}{T}\right) \\
                    y(n+1) &= x(n) \\
                    z(n+1) &= (1 - \delta)z(n) - \lambda(x(n) - x_R)
                \end{align}
                \]

                where \(x(n)\) is the membrane potential of the cell at time \(n\) with firing gain \(T\); \(y(t)\) is a 
                fast feedback inhibitory potential coupled with conductance-like constant \(K\) and \(z(t)\) is 
                the potential resulting from a slow current, such as the calcium dynamics. The slow current has a 
                recovery timescale \(1/\delta\) and a driving timescale \(1/\lambda\), with a reversal potential 
                \(x_R\).  External inputs (synaptic or otherwise) can be introduced via the parameter \(H\). All parameters 
                and variables are given in arbitrary units.

                This map has inversion symmetry, so that changing \(x_R\to-x_R\) implies in changing 
                \(\mathbf{x}(t)\to-\mathbf{x}(t)\), where \(\mathbf{x}(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)]\) is the solution of the map.Thus,
                we can choose \(x_R< 0\) without loss of generality. We keep fixed the parameters \(H=0\), \(K=0.6\), and 
                \(\delta=\lambda=0.001\), with initial conditions \(x(0)=y(0)=z(0)=1.0\).
