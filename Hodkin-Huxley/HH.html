            <h2>Hodgkin-Huxley Model</h2>
    
            <p>
                The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical framework that describes the initiation and propagation 
                of action potentials in neurons. Developed by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley in 1952, 
                it is based on experimental data obtained from the squid giant axon. This model earned them the Nobel 
                Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963 and remains one of the most detailed and accurate descriptions 
                of neuronal dynamics.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Model</h3>
    
            <p>
                The Hodgkin-Huxley model uses a system of nonlinear differential equations to represent the dynamics of 
                ion channels in the neuronal membrane. The membrane potential \(V\) evolves according to:

            <div class="equation-container">
                <div class="equations">
                    \[
                    C_m \frac{dV}{dt} = - \big( I_{Na} + I_{K} + I_{L} \big) + I_{ext},
                    \]
                    <p>
                        where \(C_m\) is the membrane capacitance, \(I_{Na}\), \(I_{K}\), and \(I_{L}\) represent the sodium, potassium, 
                        and leak currents, respectively, and \(I_{ext}\) is the external current applied to the neuron.
                    </p>
                    \[
                    I_{Na} = \overline{g_{Na}} m^3 h (V - E_{Na}), \quad
                    I_{K} = \overline{g_{K}} n^4 (V - E_{K}), \quad
                    I_{L} = \overline{g_{L}} (V - E_{L}),
                    \]
                    <p>
                        where \(\overline{g_{Na}}\), \(\overline{g_{K}}\), and \(\overline{g_{L}}\) are the maximum conductances, 
                        \(E_{Na}\), \(E_{K}\), and \(E_{L}\) are the reversal potentials, and \(m\), \(h\), and \(n\) are gating variables 
                        that evolve according to first-order differential equations.

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
    
            <p>
                The Hodgkin-Huxley model captures the complex dynamics of action potentials, including their generation, propagation, 
                and refractory periods. By analyzing the dynamics of gating variables \(m\), \(h\), and \(n\), the model provides insights 
                into the role of ion channels in shaping the electrical behavior of neurons. These gating variables are governed by 
                voltage-dependent rate equations, which describe the probabilities of channel opening and closing over time.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Coupling</h3>
    
            <p>
                In networks of neurons, the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be extended to include coupling terms, representing synaptic 
                interactions or gap junctions. Synaptic coupling introduces additional currents into the equations, allowing neurons 
                to communicate with each other and generate collective behaviors such as synchronization, oscillations, and wave 
                propagation in neural tissues.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Other Applications</h3>
    
            <p>
                Beyond its use in neuroscience, the Hodgkin-Huxley model has been applied to diverse fields, including computational 
                biology, bioengineering, and artificial intelligence. It serves as a foundation for understanding ion channel dynamics 
                in cardiac cells and contributes to the development of neuromorphic computing systems. The model's ability to simulate 
                precise electrical behavior makes it a valuable tool for designing experiments and developing treatments for neurological 
                disorders, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.
