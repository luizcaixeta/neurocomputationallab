            <h2>Rulkov Model</h2>
    
            <p>
                The Rulkov map is a two-dimensional iterated map used for modeling 
                biological neurons. Proposed by Nikolai F. Rulkov in 2001, this map offers 
                computational advantages when studying neural networks. Its simplicity in iteration 
                compared to continuous dynamical systems reduces memory usage and facilitates the computation 
                of large-scale neural networks.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Model</h3>
    
            <p>
                The Rulkov map, expressed with \(n\) as discrete time, is defined by the following 
                equations:
    
                \[
                \begin{align}
                x_{n + 1} &= \frac{\alpha}{1 + x_{n}^2} + y_{n}, \\
                y_{n + 1} &= y_{n} - \mu (x_{n} - \sigma). 
                \end{align}
                \]
    
                Here, \(x\) represents the membrane potential of the neuron, and \(y\) is a slow variable, 
                characterized by the small value of \(\mu\) (\(0 < \mu \ll 1\)). Although \(y\) lacks explicit 
                biological meaning, it may be analogized to gating variables. The parameter \(\sigma\) acts as 
                an external direct current input to the neuron, while \(\alpha\) serves as the map's nonlinearity 
                parameter. Various combinations of \(\sigma\) and \(\alpha\) yield distinct neuronal states, such as 
                resting, tonic spiking, and chaotic bursting, the latter occurring when \(\alpha > 4\).
            </p>
    
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
    
            <p>
                The dynamics of the Rulkov map can be studied by examining the behavior of its one-dimensional 
                fast submap. Since \(y\) evolves slowly, it can be approximated as a constant in \(x\)'s evolution 
                equation over moderate time spans. Depending on the value of \(y\), the submap may have one or three 
                fixed points. These include a stable point, an unstable point, and a third point whose stability 
                can vary. As \(y\) increases, the stable and unstable fixed points merge and disappear via a saddle-node 
                bifurcation.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Coupling</h3>
    
            <p>
                The coupling of two neurons has been explored by Irina Bashkirtseva and Alexander Pisarchik. Their studies 
                reveal transitions between stationary, periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic regimes. They also investigated 
                how random disturbances influence the system, leading to noise-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic 
                stochastic oscillations.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Other Applications</h3>
    
            <p>
                Variants of the Rulkov map have been applied in fields like labor and industrial economics, particularly in modeling 
                corporate dynamics. These adaptations utilize synchronization and chaos regulation to explain transitions among 
                multiple equilibria, incorporate idiosyncratic elements, and analyze the impact of effort on corporate profitability. 
                Orlando and Bufalo introduced a deterministic model based on the Rulkov map, effectively modeling fluctuations in 
                corporate yields and spreads during periods of distress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared to the 
                ARIMA-EGARCH model, which handles various aspects of volatility, the deterministic Rulkov map yields comparable results. 
                Its deterministic nature may enhance explanatory power in specific contexts.
